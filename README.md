## Description

> Toyota InfoTechnology Center (ITC), U.S.A.static analysis benchmarks for undefined behavior andconcurrency weaknesses. 100 test cases in C and C++containing a total of 685 pairs of intended weaknesses.Each pair has a version with a weakness and a fixed version.The test cases are Copyright (c) 2012-2014 and distributedunder the "BSD License."

> Please note that test cases contain coincidental weaknessesflagged by SAMATE team, each described accordingly and individually.
>
> Also please note that the SAMATE team determined that in a few cases,the code that was marked as weakness originally was in fact correct code.We describe these cases accordingly and individually.
